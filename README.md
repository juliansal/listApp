# listApp
Simple contact list app using Angular, Node, and Mongo

This contact list is the first phase of a larger project. Thanks to the "meanstacktutorial" tutorial from Michael Cheng 
(https://github.com/michaelcheng429) I'm now able to get a good starting point for my own Angular/Node projects. I am 
extending functionality from Michael's original tutorial. My version of the contact list app will include client-side and 
server-side validation.

For example:
  The "Update" button will be disabled if there is no saved contact in the form to update.
  The "Submit" button will also be disabled if there is no contact name and at least one piece of contact info.

This is part of a larger project that I'm starting, where I plan to create a media cataloging application. The user 
in the application will be able to catalog their music, video, and picture collection by name, location, and a set of 
customized tags. The tags will be created beforehand by the user first. When the user is ready to start cataloging he/she
will checkmark the tags in which the piece of media falls into for them.

I'll be working on extending the functionality in phases, as I learn and develop my skills. For the sake of clarity (and 
to increase the size of my portfolio) each phase will be it's own repository and could act as a standalone application.
